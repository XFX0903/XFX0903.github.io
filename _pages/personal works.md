- Time：2023/01/27

> This reportage piece is about a high school girl from Fujian who started a sex education team on her own, aspiring to popularize sex education for teenagers in China. I have always been in close contact with the interviewee and followed up with interviews about the founding of the sex education team, the campus sex education exhibition, the first offline sex education exhibition and the latest offline activities in January this year to complete this interview work.

> The self-curated online art exhibition "Behind the Feast" is inspired by the stories behind the various feasts in ancient Chinese paintings and calligraphy. Combined with the image understanding skills taught in the Art, Communication and History course, the exhibition attempts to tell the story behind the feast to the audience in a pictorial history.

## ✒ Advertising Creative Planning Work
&emsp;**《超级植物-逃离无趣生活》**
- Time：2022/12/05
- Link：[《超级植物-逃离无趣生活》](../assets/李蔼洁 广告创意策划作品《超级植物-逃离无趣生活》.pdf)
> This ad creative planning is the result of a group assignment. I was responsible for three major parts of this collaboration: data collection, copywriting, and creative planning. It was my first time to learn about advertising planning, and I made a lot of bold and interesting attempts, such as linking the metaphorical story of canned sardines with canned green plants, running a dumbing down contest in a busy shopping mall and collaborating with interesting artists to express our brand attitude.


## ✒ Poster Design Work
&emsp;**《新闻传播名词-舆论Public Opinion》**
- Time：2021/10/28
- Link：[《新闻传播名词-舆论Public Opinion》](../images/舆论海报.png)
> This is a poster of the news communication term "public opinion" drawn by me using Ai software. The first thing I associate with "public opinion" is that a lot of people open their mouths to speak and eventually form a collection of opinions, so the background of the poster design consists of many speakers, and the core part is a process of "opening the voice to speak", presenting the great power of a group of people's voices.
