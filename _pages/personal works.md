> This reportage piece is about a high school girl from Fujian who started a sex education team on her own, aspiring to popularize sex education for teenagers in China. I have always been in close contact with the interviewee and followed up with interviews about the founding of the sex education team, the campus sex education exhibition, the first offline sex education exhibition and the latest offline activities in January this year to complete this interview work.
