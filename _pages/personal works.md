It was my first time to learn about advertising planning, and I made a lot of bold and interesting attempts, such as linking the metaphorical story of canned sardines with canned green plants, running a dumbing down contest in a busy shopping mall and collaborating with interesting artists to express our brand attitude.

## 🎬 Curatorial Work

## 🎨 Poster Design Work
&emsp;**《新闻传播名词-舆论Public Opinion》**
- Time：2021/10/28
- Link：[《新闻传播名词-舆论Public Opinion》](../images/舆论海报.png)
> This is a poster of the news communication term "public opinion" drawn by me using Ai software. The first thing I associate with "public opinion" is that a lot of people open their mouths to speak and eventually form a collection of opinions, so the background of the poster design consists of many speakers, and the core part is a process of "opening the voice to speak", presenting the great power of a group of people's voices.
