> This reportage piece is about a high school girl from Fujian who started a sex education team on her own, aspiring to popularize sex education for teenagers in China. I have always been in close contact with the interviewee and followed up with interviews about the founding of the sex education team, the campus sex education exhibition, the first offline sex education exhibition and the latest offline activities in January this year to complete this interview work.

> The self-curated online art exhibition "Behind the Feast" is inspired by the stories behind the various feasts in ancient Chinese paintings and calligraphy. Combined with the image understanding skills taught in the Art, Communication and History course, the exhibition attempts to tell the story behind the feast to the audience in a pictorial history.
