> With my friends, we participated in the Modeling Mathematics Competition 2023. In the used boats price prediction model, we first captured a large amount of transaction data from domestic and international second-hand ship trading platforms and cleaned the data; second, we created an imbalance price prediction model, including Auto-Encoder, Time-Encoder, Self-attention Feature Fusion, and XGBoost, and used the dataset to train our model; lastly, we utilized the Model to the future price of second-hand ships prediction with an accuracy of more than 90%.

> When combining my studies in communication with data, we tried to algorithmically analyze the sentiments of the general public under the news about women in hot searches, and I was responsible for the code part of it. I used the SnowNLP algorithm for sentiment analysis, and bubbled-sorted the calculated sentiment results from the headlines and comments of all the news stories, and used the matplotlib.pyplot library to plot scatter plots to form a more visual representation of the results.
