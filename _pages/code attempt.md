>  In terms of big data, my classmates and I conducted a survey on the issue of renting rooms, which is of interest to college students. We used the requests library in python to crawl the data of Shanghai's rented rooms, including the prices, number of rooms, and locations of several well-known renting platforms in China, and combined with the actual number of graduates and their incomes, we used FineBI to draw a graphic to show what kind of houses graduates can rent in Shanghai.
