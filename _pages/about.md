## About Me
---
I'm a junior student from [School of School of Journalism and Communication](https://jc.nju.edu.cn), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn). I majored in News Reporting and Writing, and also minored in Photography and Advertising Planning.

As a journalism major, I am passionate about storytelling and communication. I have taken various courses on journalism, media, and communication, which have sharpened my critical thinking and analytical skills. Additionally, I have also participated in various internships and projects, where I have gained practical experience in news reporting, editing, and multimedia production.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I am also an active member of several clubs and organizations on campus. I enjoy volunteering, organizing events, and networking with like-minded individuals.

Through this website, I hope to showcase my academic and professional accomplishments, as well as share my perspectives and insights on journalism, media, and communication. Thank you for visiting my website, and please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments.
