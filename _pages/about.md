## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è About Me

I am now attending the School of Information Management at Nanjing University. Beforehand, I was a junior student from [School of Journalism and Communication](https://jc.nju.edu.cn), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn). I majored in News Reporting and Writing, and also minored in Photography and Advertising Planning.

As a journalism major, I am passionate about storytelling and communication. I have taken a variety of courses on journalism, media and communication that have sharpened my critical thinking and analytical skills. In addition, I have participated in various internships and programs to gain hands-on experience in news reporting, editing and multimedia production.

Moreover, I am also interested in big data and programming. I have taken python related courses during my school years, as well as participated in Modeling Mathematics Competition 2023, conducted quantitative research on kryptonite intention in B-girl games, and computational communication analysis of mass sentiment in women's news. In the future, I hope that I will be able to conduct more academic research combining data and communication.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an active member of several clubs and organizations on campus. I enjoy volunteering, organizing events, and interacting with like-minded people.

Through this website, I hope to showcase my academic and professional accomplishments and share my perspectives and insights on journalism, media, and communications. Thank you for visiting my website and please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.
